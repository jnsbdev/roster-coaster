# 🗓️ RosterCoaster – Event-Based Shift Planning Service
RosterCoaster is intended to provide a modern and user-friendly interface for coordinating shifts around events.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The system should establish a clear structure where:
- Users can create Organizations which can create events
- Each event can be divided into individual shifts
- Users should be able to sign up for available shifts on their own
- Users should be able to register and log in securely
- Each organization should manage its own events and shift plans
